# PicoPOST
## RPi Pico based POST (Power-On Self Test) Diagnostic Card

### Introduction

These are the development files for the PicoPOST, an upcoming diagnostic card for retro computers. The PicoPOST is designed to provide many additional benefits over the basic POST cards that are commonly available from Chinese vendors on eBay and other sites.

This project is in a very early phase. More information soon as it gets finalized.

### Potential Features

- Human-readable diagnostic output (by analyzing output from port 80h and other sources)
- Full bus trace log
- Voltage monitoring and alarms

### Directories

```
datasheets/  Reference documentation for components used in the PicoPOST
firmware/    Source code for the PicoPOST firmware (written in C with the official Pico SDK)
pcb/         KiCad schematics and PCB design files
```

### License
