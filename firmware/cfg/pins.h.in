/**
 * Hardware Notes!
 * 
 * Due to the limited amount of GPIO available with the RP2040 MCU, only
 * A[0..15] are being monitored by the firmware. The upper A[16..19] are
 * being filtered out by onboard logic gates, resulting in a single
 * internal "bus ready" signal.
 * This shouldn't be a problem while attempting to monitor just the BIOS
 * itself, since it should only be working with the first 16 bits.
 * Moreover, some level of "bank selection" has to take place. The
 * firmware will read 8 bits of the address at once and, after a full
 * readout, it will be merged again into a 16-bit integer.
