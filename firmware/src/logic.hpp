 * to listen for the Bus_Ready signal to come up, then it samples the address
 * and data busses in one shot. The read operation itself is so fast, the ISA
 * bus itself could be read 4 times in a single host transaction!
 * Data is then sent to the queue, so the second core can waste time for
 * printing it to USB CDC serial port. OLED output will be implemented in the
 * near future.
